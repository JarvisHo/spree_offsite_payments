SpreeOffsitePayments
====================

This gem is a [Spree Commerce](https://github.com/spree/spree) extention that integrates Shopify [Offsite_Payments](https://github.com/Shopify/offsite_payments) with Spree Commerce. As Spree extensions are Rails engines, this is therefore also a Rails engine.

It is inspired by and intended to replace [spree_alipay](https://github.com/RuanShan/spree_alipay).

## Installation
------------

Add spree_offsite_payments to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_offsite_payments'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_offsite_payments:install
```

## Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_offsite_payments/factories'
```
